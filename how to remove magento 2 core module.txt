last time we disabled two factor authentication in order to login in to the magento admin panel
so if we dont use certain modules, it is best to remove them completely 
these modules are present in /app/etc/config.php file, if the value is set to 0 that means it is disabled
'magento_twofactorauth' => 0
so alaa goes on to show the process of how to remove the package, which involves the composer.json file.
after that we run the composer update command in the terminal and wala the module is replace/removed
